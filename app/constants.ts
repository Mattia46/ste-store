        description: "This 45 features two new artists from the ever-expanding Colemine universe: Pale Jay, a budding artist, and Steve Okonksi (as Okonski) of Durand Jones and the Indications.  The A-side is a collaboration between the two artists. By The Lake is a neo-soul flip of the Okonski piano tune that’s poignant and upbeat at the same time. The lyrics come from a conversation that Pale Jay had recently with a close friend who was pondering moving to a new city to pursue a budding love affair, but ultimately chose to stay put because they had not overcome an old heart break. When he heard Okinski’s song, Runner Up, from his upcoming album, he immediately latched onto the lingering feeling of speaking to his friend and wrote By The Lake in the next thirty minutes after chopping up Okonski’s piano samples.  The B-side, Runner Up, features the original track by Okonski. Recorded at the Colemine HQ in Loveland, OH, Runner Up exhibits a triumphant yet melancholic melody in the piano that leads to a more reserved B-section driven by the drums and bass of Aaron Frazer and Michael Isvara “Ish” Montgomery."

        description: "Reeling is Say She She’s latest emboldened declaration to fight dystopia. Written as an incantation from Mother Earth to the masses to join the rising against the calamitous forces of unfettered capitalism that has left our seas and skies grappling. With soaring harmonics and perfectly in sync voices, the She She’s lead the charge to “Kick the Door Down, Smash the ceiling… Leave ‘em Reeling.”  The B-side, 'Don't You Dare Stop,' is a passionate sonnet written about a former flame who once whispered the words…Don't You Dare Stop. Brimming with a yearning so amorous it burns everything to the ground with scorching hot vocals and breathy high tones."

        description: "The Harlem Gospel Travelers were brought together by Eli Paperboy Reed, as they were students that he was mentoring as part of a gospel class he was teaching. As the students began to develop their own style and write songs, Eli decided they needed to get into the studio and put something down. So he enlisted the help of friends to serve as a band for his students, including drummer Aaron Frazer (Durand Jones & The Indications, The Flying Stars Of Brooklyn NY), and the results speak for themselves. Old-school, get up and shout southern gospel!"
